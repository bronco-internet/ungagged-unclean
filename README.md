# Ungagged 2016 Unclean Tool
This is the code base for a small web app we put together for a talk at Ungagged 2016 (http://www.ungagged.com/), slides for this talk are seen here http://www.slideshare.net/broncoseo/spaghetti-western-of-link-building-ungagged-june-2016

We've released this code due to a number of requests we've had from others wanting to host it.

## Demo
http://www.bronco.co.uk/our-ideas/ungagged/

## Usage
The app uses Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/) and Python 2.

If you decide to use the code, please send some love our way :)
